<p>
This reel is a collection of animated projects over the last several years.

<p>
My primary profession out of college was motion graphics and video editing. I mostly worked in 2D animation but have experience with character rigging, cel animation, c4d, compositing, UI animation, and color grading.

Some of the projects featured above are animated explainer videos, website manifestos, performance marketing ads, social content, logo animations, music videos, and a few personal projects.
