<p>
This was a promotional video for Bluewolf's annual State of Salesforce report. This is a high-priority project they publish every year to show how the best companies get the most value using Salesforce. 
</p>

<p>
I was brought in to translate this into a catchy and engaging video to tease the reportâ€™s release.
</p>

<p>
Basing my visuals off of the report's style guide, I edited and animated this video to an upbeat jazz track that brought high-energy and elegance to the project.
</p>

<p>
I also created supplementary content for the video, including motion graphics projection inside a tunnel for an event at Dreamforce 2017.
