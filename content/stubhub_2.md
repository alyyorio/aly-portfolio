<p>
The main purpose of StubHub’s social content strategy was to show fans how live event culture can fit into their everyday lives. 
</p>

<p>
We had a multi-faceted approach in how we created content for our main platforms (Twitter, IG, and Facebook) from fan photos at events to memes to monthly horoscopes.

As Art Director of StubHub’s community social channels, I worked with our Social Media Managers to ideate and execute on our team’s strategy, along with my copywriter partner.

Above is a small sample of the work I did over 1.5 years. All assets were animated, illustrated, designed, and photographed by myself.
