<p>
Tally is a consumer tech company pioneering full-service financial automation via debt consolidation and low-interest lines of credit. They were looking to refresh and modernize the brand for their target audience.
</p>

<p>
The role primarily involved defining how the system presented itself across performance marketing ads and social media content. I helped establish how all the brand pieces (text, containers, color, and illustration) interacted with and played off of each other to form the baseline look for all digital content.

<p>
Secondary to the role was working closely with the agency BUCK to determine the art direction of the animated sticker assets that were the extra 'oomph' and added layer to the brand direction. Together, the team and I were able to elevate the illustrations from uninspired tech content to wonderfully metaphorical and expressive animations.
