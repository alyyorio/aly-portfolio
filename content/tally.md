Tally project description.
</p>

<p>
With a team of six designers, we landed on the concept of “Overlay” as the most apt way to describe the experiences accumulated over the past five years in the program and how many layers of knowledge and skill create stronger designers.
</p>

<p>
My responsibilities consisted of determining the visual direction of the brand as well as the development of the icon system. I also lead the team in charge of the motion bumpers and did the primary photography/videography for each student.
