<p>
This was the branding for my college senior Graphic Communication Design (GRCD) exhibition.
</p>

<p>
With a team of six designers, we landed on the concept of “Overlay” as the most apt way to describe the experiences accumulated over the past five years in the program and how layers of knowledge and skill created stronger designers.
</p>

<p>
My responsibilities consisted of determining the visual direction of the brand as well as the development of the icon system. I also lead the team in charge of the motion bumpers and did the primary photography/videography for each student.

<p>
The above is a mix of our pitch deck and final execution. Check out the original proposal here.
