<p>
StubHubâ€™s latest rebrand is centered around two core ideas. First: create an intimtate, authentic experience for fans globally. Second: have a fresh look that offers flexibility across all channels from performance marketing to event activations.
</p>

<p>
Given these perameters, the team recallibrated our photography style from studio shot images to real photography for authenticity. 
</p>

<p>
We then developed two treatments for our type and graphic elements. A barring system for better informational design in our performance ads as well as a fractal element based off of the logo for something more visual and ownable as a brand.
</p>

<p>
I was involved in every stage of the redesign, from early concepting and photography exploration to final execution, animation, and implementation of the system.
